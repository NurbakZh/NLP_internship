# REPORT FOR NLP_internship
## 1. Details of the work and description of how functions work are displayed in .ipynb file, you can read it through and check the data
## 2. Difficulties that I faced during the completion of the task:
 * ####I was new to conllu type of data and it took me some time to dive into this topic and understand how to work with it, however documentation from the official web-site helped me much.
 * ####Lack of knowledge and understanding about NLP and it’s concepts, which lead to spending a lot of time to understand what features should I extract from sentences and how to present it; even though presented report helped me much with raw features and morpho-syntactic ones, syntactic features were much unclearer for me, and I didn’t add some of them due to not understanding how to work with them.
